    "Ans - MongoDB - MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a\n",
    "NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. \n",
    "It is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows us\n",
    "to work with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Database - A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and\n",
    "columns. Such databases use the storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data \n",
    "being stored. e.g. - simple key-value pairs, JSON documents, or as a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios for preferring MongoDB over SQL Databases -\n",
    "MongoDB is more suited than SQL databases for real-time analytics, content management, Internet of Things, mobile\n",
    "and other types of applications.\n",
    "When we have unstructured and/or structured data with raapid growth potential, then in those scenarios MongoDB is \n",

    "'''Que 2- State and explain features ---------\n",
    "Ans - Features of MongoDB are as follows -\n",
    "a) Support ad hoc queries - MongoDB allows search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression\n",
    "searches.\n",
    "b) Indexing - MongoDB allows any field in the document to be indexed.\n",
    "c) Replication - MongoDB supports Master Slave replication. A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave \n",
    "copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "d) Duplication of data - MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and \n",
    "also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "e) - Load balancing - MongoDB has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "f) Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "g) Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\n",
    "h) It is a schema-less database written in C++.\n",
    "i) Provides high performance.\n",
    "j) Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
    "k) Easy to administer in the case of failures.\n",
    "l) It also supports JSON data model with dynamic schemas, Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability, Built in \n",
    "replication for high availability\n",
