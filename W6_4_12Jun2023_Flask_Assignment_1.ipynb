    "Que 1 - What is Flask Framework? What are -----------------------\n",
    "Ans - Flask is a web development framework written in Python. It provides tools, libraries and technologies that \n",
    "allows to build a web application. It is easy to learn and use. It is a WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) \n",
    "framework. Flask is considered a micro web framework. It is not dependent upon external libraries to perform the\n",
    "tasks of a framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of flask framework -\n",
    "a) Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework because it is independent of external libraries and it gives a \n",
    "quick start for web development having complex applications.\n",
    "b) Compatible: Flask is compatible with the latest technologies such as machine learning, agile development, cloud\n",
    "technologies, etc.\n",
    "c) Independent: Flask allows full control to the developers for creating web applications. A developer can do the\n",
    "experiment with the libraries and architecture of the framework.\n",
    "d) Integrated Unit Testing: Flask offers an integrated unit testing feature that helps in faster debugging, robust\n",
    "development, and independence to do experiments.\n",
    "e) Flexible and Scalable: Flask supports WSGI templates that help in flexibility and scalability in the web \n",
    "development process. \n",
    "g) Secure Cookies: Secure cookie is an attribute of an HTTP request that enables the security of channels and \n",
    "ensures no unauthorized person has access to the text. Flask supports the feature of secure cookies. \n",
    "h) It is suitable for single-page application.\n",
    "i) Flask provides an in-built debugger that offers virtual debugging.\n",

    "'''Que 5 - What function is used in flask for URL binding? Write a ------------------------\n",
    "Ans - There are two ways through which we can bind the URLs to their associated function:-\n",
    "1.) Using route() decorator\n",
    "2.) Using add_url_rule() function\n",
    "\n",
    "1) route() decorator - The route() decorator in Flask is used to bind URL to a function. \n",

    "            @app.route('/route-name')\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, URL '/hello' rule is bound to the hello_world() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) add_url_rule() function - URL mapping can be done by using the add_url_rule() function. This approach is mainly \n",
    "used to import the view function from another module. In fact, the app.route() calls this function internally.\n",
    "Syntax -\n",
